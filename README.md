# Sample Generation Language (SGL) Specification

This spec was generated by using GPT-4 as an assistant.

The Sample Generation Language (SGL) is a text-based format for describing and generating audio samples using various synthesis techniques. The format is designed to be versatile and can be used to create samples for various music genres, including chiptune, acid trance, drum & bass, trance, EDM, demoscene music, and new experimental sounds.
